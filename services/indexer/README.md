# StellarCred Indexer Service

An event ingestion and query service for StellarCred's on-chain Soroban contracts.

The indexer continuously polls Soroban contract events emitted by `ProofRegistry` (and other registry contracts), ingests them into a local database (SQLite or PostgreSQL), and exposes a lightweight HTTP API for client applications, wallets, and community explorers. Read endpoints are public by default; authenticated app review and webhook subscription management are write operations.

---

## Features

- **Soroban Contract Event Ingestion**: Monitors ledger events (`submitted`, `revoked`, `paused`, `unpaused`) according to the authoritative [EVENTS.md](../../EVENTS.md) schema and maintains verified claim state per wallet.
- **Pluggable Database Storage**: Supports SQLite (for local development and single-instance deployments) and PostgreSQL (for production multi-instance deployments).
- **CORS Policy**: Configurable origin allowlisting (`CORS_ORIGIN` / `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`) with secure default-deny in production.
- **Per-IP Rate Limiting**: Built-in fixed-window rate limiting responding with HTTP `429 Too Many Requests` and `Retry-After` headers.
- **Claim Lifecycle Webhooks**: Authenticated wallet/claim-type subscriptions receive signed revocation and expiry notifications with durable retry state.
- **Zero Identity Exposure**: Ingests and stores only public on-chain commitments and verification metadata. No user identity fields are stored or processed.

## Security & Architecture

### CORS Configuration
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is enforced via `CORS_ORIGIN` (or `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`):
- **Development**: Defaults to `http://localhost:3000` when unset.
- **Production**: Defaults to same-origin / default-deny when unset.
- **Custom Origins**: Supply comma-separated origins (e.g. `https://stellarcred.app, https://app.stellarcred.xyz`) or `*` for public access.

### Rate Limiting
To prevent scraping and denial-of-service, all HTTP endpoints are protected by per-IP rate limiting:
- **Default limits**: 120 requests per 60-second window per IP.
- **Headers included**:
  - `RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests permitted within the window.
  - `RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining request quota in the current window.
  - `RateLimit-Reset`: Number of seconds until the rate limit window resets.
- **429 Response**: When the quota is exceeded, the server returns status `429` with a `Retry-After: <seconds>` header and `{ "error": "too many requests", "retryAfter": <seconds> }`.

### Authentication & API Key Policy
- **Decision**: Public read endpoints (`/health`, `/claims`, `/stats`, `/recent`) do **not** require API keys.
- **Rationale**: The indexer provides read access to public, non-sensitive blockchain state. Requiring API keys for reads would introduce friction for decentralized dApp frontends, community explorers, and wallet integrations. Abuse resistance is achieved via per-IP rate limiting and CORS policy rather than API key gating.

## HTTP API Endpoints

Responses are JSON unless noted otherwise. Read endpoints are public by default;
administrative writes and webhook subscription management require `API_KEY`.

### 1. `GET /health`
Returns the operational health of the indexer and the last processed ledger sequence.
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "lastLedger": 1234567
}
```

### 2. `GET /claims?wallet=G...`
Retrieves all recorded credential claims (active and revoked) for a Stellar wallet address.
```json
{
  "wallet": "GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWHF",
  "claims": [
    {
      "wallet": "GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWHF",
      "credential_type": "kyc",
      "issuer": "GISSUER...",
      "verified_at": 1724000000,
      "expiry": 1755000000,
      "ledger_sequence": 1234560,
      "threshold": null,
      "revoked": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. `GET /stats`
Returns aggregated claim counts grouped by credential type.
```json
{
  "stats": [
    {
      "credential_type": "kyc",
      "total": 150,
      "active": 145,
      "revoked": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. `GET /recent?limit=20&cursor=<opaque>`
Returns recent active (non-revoked) verified claims, newest first.

Pagination is **keyset (cursor) based** — ordered by `(ledger_sequence, id)` and
driven by the opaque `nextCursor` returned with each page, so the feed stays
stable (no duplicates or skipped rows) while new claims are ingested between
requests, and there is no OFFSET skip cost on large tables. Omit `cursor` for
the first page; a `null` `nextCursor` means there are no more claims. `limit`
(default `20`, clamped to a max of `100`) controls the page size.

```json
{
  "claims": [...],
  "limit": 20,
  "nextCursor": "MTA6MTI="
}
```

### Real-time claim subscriptions (`#392`)

The `/recent` feed and `/claims?wallet=` snapshot are the two endpoints the
SDK's `subscribeClaims()` helper (`@stellarcred/sdk`, see
[frontend/packages/sdk/README.md](../../frontend/packages/sdk/README.md))
composes into a push subscription: it tails `/recent` once per poll for
`gained` events (keyset cursor over `nextCursor`), and periodically re-reads
`/claims?wallet=` to reconcile `revoked` flags into `lost` events. Protocols
can therefore build their own feeds from the same pair without touching
Soroban RPC, or call the helper directly.

Because every subscription tick costs one `/recent` call plus one `/claims`
call per wallet per `resyncMs`, size `RATE_LIMIT_MAX` for the expected
`watched-wallets / resync-interval` request rate when serving many
subscribers.

## Database Backend Selection & Tradeoffs

The indexer is a thin storage layer over one of two backends, selected at
startup with the `DB_DRIVER` environment variable:

| `DB_DRIVER` | Engine          | Connection config            | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sqlite` (default) | better-sqlite3 (`journal_mode=WAL`) | `SQLITE_PATH` | local dev, demos, single-instance / hobby deployments |
| `postgres` | node-postgres pool | `DATABASE_URL` | production multi-instance deployments |

**How selection works.** `loadConfig()` reads `DB_DRIVER` (defaulting to
`sqlite`) and validates it. `createDb()` then returns the matching adapter and
runs the schema migrations for that engine. `DATABASE_URL` **must** be set
when `DB_DRIVER=postgres` (and is ignored by the SQLite adapter). Everything
above the adapter — the ingester and the HTTP API — is backend-agnostic and
talks only to the `Db` interface, so adding a new backend means implementing
that interface, not touching the business logic.

**Tradeoffs.**

- **Operational scale** — SQLite is embedded in the process (zero
  infrastructure,  single file, WAL for concurrent readers) and is perfect for
  local development and single-instance nodes. Postgres is a standalone
  service that supports concurrent writers and many readers, which is what a
  multi-instance / horizontally-scaled deployment needs.
- **Concurrency** — SQLite allows a single writer process; if you run more than
  one indexer instance against the same SQLite file you can corrupt/resolve the
  cursor incorrectly. Postgres serializes writes with row-level locking and a
  shared cursor row.
- **Operational tooling** — Postgres gives you replication, backups, managed
  hosting, and point-in-time recovery out of the box; SQLite needs your own
  file-backup strategy.
- **Dependency footprint** — SQLite (via `better-sqlite3`) adds a native
  module to `node_modules`; the Postgres driver (`pg`) is pure JS. Choose the
  default (`sqlite`) unless you actually need Postgres's scaling and tooling.

> **Recommendation:** run `sqlite` in development and single-instance
> production; enable `postgres` only when you need multiple reader/writer
> instances or managed database tooling.

**Testing both backends.** The worker test suite runs the **same DB test
matrix against SQLite and Postgres** (`src/db.test.ts`). Coverage includes
schema migrations (idempotency), ledger-cursor updates, claim upserts,
revokes, `claimsByWallet`, `stats`, paginated `recent`, `deleteClaimsAfter`
and `getMaxClaimLedger`. The SQLite leg always runs locally; the Postgres leg
runs in CI (via the `postgres` service container in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`)and locally whenever `TEST_POSTGRES_URL` (or `DATABASE_URL`) points at a live
Postgres, and is skipped otherwise:

```bash
# SQLite leg only (no Postgres reachable):
npm test

# Both legs, against a local Postgres, e.g. `docker run ... -p 5432:5432 postgres`: 
TEST_POSTGRES_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/db npm test
```

Because the two engines use different SQL dialects (`INSERT OR IGNORE` vs
`ON CONFLICT`, `INTEGER` vs `BIGINT`), the matrix is exactly where silent
cross-backend divergences surface (e.g. Postgres returning `BIGINT` columns as
strings) — running it on both is how we keep either backend from rotting.

## Protocol claim lifecycle webhooks

Protocols with ongoing access should **gate each request using the live
`hasClaim`/on-chain check, then reconcile their existing access state when a
revocation or expiry notification arrives**. Neither is sufficient alone:
request-time checks prevent stale grants at the next request, while webhook
notifications let a protocol proactively close sessions, positions, or
subscriptions that are already active.

The indexer queues notifications for one exact `(wallet, claimType)` pair.
Issuer revocations are detected from indexed ProofRegistry events; expiry is
detected by the regular indexer poll once `expiry <= now`. Delivery is
asynchronous and eventual, with a delay bounded by the configured polling
interval, finality lag, and delivery retries. The upgraded ProofRegistry also
emits an event for holder self-revocation; deployments on older contract
versions must upgrade before those revocations can generate notifications.
The normal request-time on-chain check remains necessary.

Set both `API_KEY` and a random `WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` of at least 32
characters before registering subscriptions. The API key protects subscription
management. The webhook secret signs deliveries and is never returned by the
API; configure the same secret in the receiver's secret manager and never
expose it in a browser/client. Subscription URLs must use HTTPS and resolve
only to public IP addresses.

### Manage subscriptions

All routes below require `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>` or `X-API-Key`.
Subscriptions are specific to one wallet and claim type; create one per pair
the protocol relies on.

```http
POST /webhooks/subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "url": "https://protocol.example/stellarcred/events",
  "wallet": "G...",
  "claimType": "kyc"
}
```

The response is `{ "id": 12, "wallet": "G...", "claimType": "kyc" }`.
Repeated registration of the same URL/wallet/type is idempotent. List with
`GET /webhooks/subscriptions?wallet=G...`, inspect recent attempts with
`GET /webhooks/subscriptions/:id/deliveries`, and remove a subscription with
`DELETE /webhooks/subscriptions/:id`. Removing a subscription does not cancel
deliveries already queued for it.

### Event payload and signature

The indexer sends `claim.revoked` or `claim.expired` JSON payloads:

```json
{
  "eventId": "revoked:...",
  "type": "claim.revoked",
  "wallet": "G...",
  "claimType": "kyc",
  "expiry": 1755000000,
  "ledgerSequence": 1234560,
  "occurredAt": 1724000000,
  "reasonCode": "issuer_revoked"
}
```

For expiry, `type` is `claim.expired`, `occurredAt` is the credential expiry,
and `reasonCode` is `credential_expired`. Delivery includes
`X-StellarCred-Timestamp` (Unix seconds) and
`X-StellarCred-Signature: sha256=<hex>`. Verify it as HMAC-SHA256 over
`<timestamp>.<raw request body>` with `WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET`, compare
signatures in constant time, and reject stale timestamps. Use `eventId` for
idempotency: successful delivery is at-least-once, not exactly-once.
Unsuccessful attempts retry with exponential backoff (5 seconds, doubling up
to one hour) for at most eight attempts. Inspect delivery history and reconcile
from the chain if retries are exhausted.

## Consistency, Finality & Reorg Guarantees

- **Cursor Progression**: The indexer stores the last successfully processed ledger sequence in database metadata. In the event of a restart, ingestion resumes seamlessly from the saved checkpoint without skipping events.
- **Idempotency**: Ingested events and claim records are keyed by `(contract_id, topic, ledger_sequence, tx_hash)`, making replays and repeated ingestion fully idempotent.
- **Finality**: Stellar consensus achieves deterministic single-slot finality (~5 seconds per ledger). By polling confirmed ledgers via Soroban RPC `getEvents`, the indexer avoids unconfirmed/mempool race conditions.
